> #### Essential Softwares:

   <br> or, MAMP ( Specially for Mac) ( Download Link: https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)
2. Node.js (LTS version) ( Download Link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ )
3. Composer ( Download Link: https://getcomposer.org/download/ )
4. Git ( Download Link: https://git-scm.com/downloads )
5. Visual Studio Code (Free Code Editor) ( Download Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download )
6. PHPStorm (Paid Code Editor) ( Download Link: https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download )

### If you are going to use PHPStorm as your code editor then no need to install any plugin as PHPStorm ships with built-in support for PHP and Laravel.

> ### VS Code Extensions:

> Note: If you don't want to install the extentions from No. 4 to 15 one by one, then you can just install this `Laravel Extension Pack` extention which will also install all of those plugins as well.
